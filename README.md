# Unifying Consensus and Covariance Intersection for Efficient Distributed State Estimation Over Unreliable Networks

Implementation of a distributed state estimation filter that uses a hybrid approach: it uses iterative covariance intersection to reach consensus over priors, which might become correlated, while consensus over new information is handled using weights based on a Metropolis–Hastings Markov chain. The performance of the hybrid method is evaluated extensively, including comparisons with competing algorithms, with a hypothetical “full history” yardstick, and centralized performance and check for filter consistency using the NEES test. We conduct an assessment on a realistic atmospheric dispersion problem and also on more carefully crafted settings to help characterize particular aspects of the performance.
